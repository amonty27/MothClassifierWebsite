Hi, my name is Alicia Montgomery. Not only am I a Computer Science Major at GW, I am also pursuing a minor in Fine Arts. I have a passion for creating, from coding new programs to painting a figure to working a laser printer, I enjoy anything that involves making something new. I also love playing video games, catching up with my favorite shows, and working out (when time permits). In the future, I would love (and am currently trying) to work as either a UX/UI Designer or a Mobile App Developer.

Hi, my name is Abia Khan and I am a Computer Science and Biology major at GWU. Iâ€™ve always been passionate about using my computer science skills in biology and since then have spent most of my time at GWU participating in interdisciplinary research projects combining the two fields. My area of interest has always been in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. In the future, I plan on going to grad school in Computer Science so I can get more research opportunities and advance my career.
